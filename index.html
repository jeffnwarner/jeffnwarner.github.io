                    InMails, positively impacting the acceptance rate of
                    InMails. <br>
                    Implemented solutions that resulted in a
                    substantial decrease in the number of untracked InMails,
                    contributing to improved tracking and analytics. <br>
                    Enhanced recruiter user experience with major UI redesign of
                    recruiter inbox. Successfully addressed and resolved
                    customer issues with accessibility on the recruiter inbox. <br>
                    Accessibility was enhanced for visually impaired customers
                    by improving keyboard navigation and adjustments to how
                    screen readers interacted with the inbox. <br>
                    Engineered and implemented all enhancements to the recruiter

            <h4>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science</h4>
            <p>
                During my time at UC Davis, I delved deep into the fundamentals
                of Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures, establishing
                a robust foundation in core computer science concepts. The
                academic journey extended beyond the basics, allowing me to
                explore elective classes that significantly shaped my
                understanding of the field. Notably, a Software Engineering
                class provided practical insights into building scalable and
                maintainable software, while an AI class delved into the
                exciting realm of machine learning. <br>

                Beyond the classroom, I actively participated in the Davis
                Computer Science Club, where I held the role of Chair of
                Professional Development. This leadership position allowed me to
                facilitate an environment of growth, fostering connections

                experience contributing to the development of my peers as they
                navigated their academic and professional paths. <br>

                The academic and extracurricular experiences at UC Davis have
                not only equipped me with technical skills but have also
                instilled a passion for continuous learning and community

                        <h3>Abrazame</h3>
                        <p>
                            "Abrazame" is a prototype developed as part of the
                            Tech for Social Good initiative. This social media
                            app is thoughtfully crafted with a focus on
                            supporting victims of domestic abuse. The platform
                            provides a secure space, similar to a Twitter clone,
                            where users can post and engage anonymously to
                            protect their identities from potential threats.<br>
                            Modeled after Twitter, the app allows users to make
                            posts and engage in discussions while maintaining
                            complete anonymity, prioritizing user safety.<br>
                            Implementation of user anonymity serves as a
                            protective measure, ensuring a secure environment
                            for victims of domestic abuse.<br>
                            Introduced a heat map feature displaying locations
                            of public resources, aiding users in finding
                            essential support services.<br>
                            Established a robust Firebase database to facilitate
                            the storage and retrieval of posts, comments, and
                            user information.<br>
                            Designed the foundational structure of the
                            "Twitter-like" aspects of the app, laying the
                            groundwork for future visual enhancements and
                            improved user experience.<br>
                            "Abrazame" exemplifies the potential of technology
                            to address social issues, providing a prototype that
                            can empower and support individuals facing
                            challenges in sensitive situations.

                            system that enables seamless communication between
                            players. Focused on server-side interactions,
                            ensuring efficient message delivery to the server
                            and real-time updates on users' pages. <br>
