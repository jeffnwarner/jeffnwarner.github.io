					<p>
						 I graduated from UC Davis where I majored in Computer Science.<br>
                         My most recent position was as a contractor at LinkedIn where I worked as a Front End Engineer 
                         on the Recruiter Messaging Team in LinkedIn Talent Solutions.<br>
                         I have both experience as a Front End Engineer and as a Fullstack Engineer, 
                         with more experience on the Front End.<br>
                         I have some wide experience garnered from multiple projects 
                         in mobile development, web development, and game design.<br>
                         Some things I learned in my projects are that working in a team can help lead to expedited 
                         learning and that working through roadblocks is the best way to learn.

                <h3>VICTR Lab</h3>
                <h4>Undergraduate Intern</h4>
                <p>
                    VICTR Lab is a lab in the Communications department at UC Davis.<br>
                    Professor Jorge Pena is the director there and he conducts 
                    research on behaviors within virtual environments.<br>
                    During my internship here I worked on two projects, a video game and a social media app.<br>
                    I helped develop both projects in small teams of students majoring in Computer Science.<br>
                    I helped many of my underclassmen out on their portions of the project.<br>
                    I was also often the one who tested the projects to make sure 
                    it was usuable before user experience tests.<br>
                    The video game I helped produce was used in the study 
                    "Personality Traits and Perceptions About Guns Affect the Relationship Between Violence Justification and Guilt."<br>
                    This study was featured in the 70th Annual International Communications Association Conference in 2020.

                        <p>
                            This is an Android App built in Android Studio written in Java.<br>
                            The app is designed to help induce lucid dreaming in users through a frequency generator.<br>
                            The app also includes a dream journal for users to quickly write down the dreams that they had to better remember them later.<br>
                            There is also a training feature for the users in the form of a notification system.<br>
                            The training consists of the app repeatedly giving the users notifications throughout the day so they can condition themselves to ask the question "Am I dreaming?"<br>
                            Training the user to ask this question is another way to help them realize that they are dreaming while asleep and will help them dream lucidly.<br>
                            The dream journal can sync to a Firebase database and can also be seen on our website for users who wish to write their journals on their computers instead of their phones.

                        <h3>Cops and Robbers</h3>
                        <p>
                            At VICTR Lab one of the projects I worked on was a video game made in Unity.<br>
                            This video game is a "first-person shooter" that was used in the study "Personality Traits and Perceptions About Guns Affect the Relationship Between Violence Justification and Guilt."<br>
                            This study measured the perception of violence justification through two different scenarios.<br>
                            Participants were randomly selected to play out the scenario of either a police officer being attacked by robbers, or the scenario of a robber getting surrounded by police officers.<br>
                            Participants would then answer survey questions to recount whether they believed that their actions of violence were justified depending on the scenario they were given.<br>
                            For this project I worked on designing the level the player walked around in by taking a building asset from the Unity Asset Store and rearranging it so that the player and enemies could better hide behind shelves.<br>
                            I also helped program many functions the player had such as shooting the gun and crouching.<br>
                            As well as many scripts for player feedback to being shot such as adding blood to the screen when the player is shot as well as indicating to the player where the shot came from.

                        <p>
                            This is a prototype for an app made for Tech for Social Good.<br>
                            This social media app is designed with victims of domestic abuse in mind.<br>
                            For the most part, it is a Twitter like clone where users can make posts and comment on posts, but the users are all anonymous to protect the users identities in case unwanted people find the app.<br>
                            There is also a heat map of locations of public resoures for users to find. The main component that I worked on was the social media aspect of it.<br>
                            I set up a Firebase database for this project and implemented the functionality of sending posts, comments, and other user information to the database.<br>
                            I also created the structure of the "Twitter-like" aspects so the app could be picked up later after I graduated and would simply just need the visual design and implement better user experience.

                            Player information, as well as all the posts in the forums, and all messages between players were kept on a MySQL database using a server on Amazon Web Services.<br>
                            The main component I worked on was the messaging system between the players, specifically the server side interactions of sending the messages to our server and updating the information on users pages in the background when they get their messages.
