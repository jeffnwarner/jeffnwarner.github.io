						 I am a recent graduate from UC Davis where I majored in Computer Science. I have some wide experience garnered from multiple projects in mobile development, web development, and game design. I have experience in many programming languages and know the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures. Some things I learned in my projects are that working in a team can help lead to expedited learning and that working through roadblocks is the best way to learn.

                <h3>VICTR Lab</h3>
                <h4>Undergraduate Intern</h4>
                <p>
                     VICTR Lab is a lab in the Communications department at UC Davis. Professor Jorge Pena is the director there and he enjoys conducting research on behaviors within virtual environments. During my internship here I worked on two projects, a video game and a social media app. I helped develop both projects in small teams of students majoring in Computer Science. I helped many of my underclassmen out on their portions of the project. I was also often the one who tested the projects to make sure it was usuable before user experience tests.

            <p>
                At UC Davis I learned the basics of programming as well as the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures. I also got to learn a lot from some elective classes like a Software Engineering class and an AI class. I was also a part of the Davis Computer Science Club as the Chair of Professional Development.

                        <h3>Lucid You</h3>
                        <p>
                            This is an Android App built in Android Studio written in Java. The app is designed to help induce lucid dreaming in users through a frequency generator. The generated frequency should theoretically resonate with the users brain frequencies at a level that makes it more likely to have lucid dreams. The app also includes a dream journal for users to quickly write down the dreams that they had to better remember them later. There is also a training feature for the users in the form of a notification system. The training consists of the app repeatedly giving the users notifications throughout the day so they can condition themselves to ask the question "Am I dreaming?" Training the user to ask this question is another way to help them realize that they are dreaming while asleep and will help them dream lucidly. The dream journal can sync to a Firebase database and can also be seen on our website for users who wish to write their journals on their computers instead of their phones.

                        <p>
                            At VICTR Lab one of the projects I worked on was a video game made in Unity. This video game is a "first-person shooter" with the purpose of it being used in a social experiment on people's thoughts on gun control. Players will answer a survey on their opinions and then play through the game and take the survey again to see if their opinions were affected at all after being in a virtual environment. For this project I worked on designing the level the player walked around in by taking a building asset from the Unity Asset Store and rearranging it so that the player and enemies could better hide behind shelves. I also helped program many functions the player had such as shooting the gun and crouching. As well as many scripts for player feedback to being shot such as adding blood to the screen when the player is shot as well as indicating to the player where the shot came from.

                            This is a prototype for an app made for Tech for Social Good. This social media app is designed with victims of domestic abuse in mind. For the most part, it is a Twitter like clone where users can make posts and comment on posts, but the users are all anonymous to protect the users identities in case unwanted people find the app. There is also a heat map of locations of public resoures for users to find.
